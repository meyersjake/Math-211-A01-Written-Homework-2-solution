(a) For what value(s) of d is span{⃗u, ⃗v, ⃗w} a plane?
(b) Is there a value of d so span{⃗u, ⃗v, ⃗w} a line? Explain.
2. Let G ⊆ R
2 be the graph of the line given by the equation y = 3x + 2. Find vectors ⃗d and ⃗p
so that
G = {⃗x ∈ R
2
: ⃗x = t
⃗d + ⃗p for some t ∈ R}.
3. Let ⃗v =

,
X = {⃗x ∈ R

: ⃗x · ⃗v = 0}
Y = {⃗x ∈ R
2
: ⃗x · ⃗v = −3}.
(a) Draw X and Y . What do you notice? Are either of them subspaces?
(b) Find a vector ⃗w so that
Y = {⃗x + ⃗w : ⃗x ∈ X}.
